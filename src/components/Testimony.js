        "The class was fun and enjoying. I really loved learning in the class as the tutors there were kind and helpful. They taught me many things I had not known and I got my certificate happily. I am grateful to my tutors for providing and guiding me through this fun and nourishing experience. MCI Academy is a fun place to go and I would recommend it to my friends. Thank you fellow friends and teachers for helping me through coding. üò∑ LOVE YOU! üòÅüòÅüòÅ",

        "The MCI coding class of 2022, which happens to be the very first class was no doubt a period to be ever grateful of. ‚ÄúEducation is not just the learning of facts but an avenue were characters are built and self discoveries made.  Having very keen Tutors was something anyone would applaud, they were always willing and ready to see you at the best. Of course, my team mates during the coding class were awesome! Fun, patience, discipline, self denial, motivation and more were all experienced. MCI coding class is the best place to grow coding and even to become a better person as a web programmer and by extension a better human being. I love MCI, I love Coding and I appreciate the best training I ever had as a beginner.ü•∞ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è",

        "Applying for Careers in Code was one of the best decisions I've made in my entire life! Over the course of 6 months, I went from a little knowledge of HTML and CSS to a full-stack JavaScript web developer. The instructors  were always willing to go out of their way to help with anything we needed throughout the duration of class. I'm thrilled I got the opportunity to train in a field that I'm passionate about and I look forward to contributing to MCI Academy",
